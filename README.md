**Main Tasks:**  
- Based on the size of feature number and sample size (more or less than 1000), four different kinds of datasets were selected  
- Data cleaning, missing value processing, and non-equilibrium samples were processed by SMOTE method  
- Training (parameter tunning) and forecasting separately with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN and SVM  
- Compare different classification algorithms based on ROC, AUC, time cost and other indicators  

**Language: Python**
